// Synchronous: Operations are executed one after another, in sequence.
//  Each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before it can start. (Blocking)









// Asynchronous: Operations can be initiated and the program can continue to run other tasks without waiting for them to complete.
//  The operation runs in the background and signals when it's done,
//  often using callbacks, promises, or async/await. (Non-blocking)
